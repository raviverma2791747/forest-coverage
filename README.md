# Forest Coverage in Aerial Imagery using Image segmentation

## Overview
Climate change is a challenge of the 21st century brought about by the Industrial Age and high resource consumption by the Human population worldwide. 
Due to the exponential surge in the population of humans, forest coverage has drastically reduced worldwide, bringing catastrophic changes in climate. 
The large satellite aerial imagery can detect the extent of damages brought about by human activities. The automatic deforestation detection can help the 
cause of climate change and policy framing for stakeholders like governments, local populations, etc. The extent of deforestation can be used to assess illegal 
logging, forest fires and human activities
